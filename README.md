# Tomato Plant Health Classifier üçÖ
A deep learning model using CNN to predict the health of tomato plants based on a leaf image. Divided into 3 classes:
1. tomato_early_blight: Indicates the presence of disease symptoms in the tomato plant
2. tomato_healthy: Indicates a healthy tomato plant
3. tomato_late_blight: Indicates that the tomato plant is diseased
